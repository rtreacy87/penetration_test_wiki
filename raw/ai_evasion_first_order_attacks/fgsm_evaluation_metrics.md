# Evaluation Metrics



With the core FGSM attack implemented, we now build metrics to
evaluate its effectiveness. Flip rate alone doesn’t tell the full story.
What happens to model confidence? How much did perturbations actually
change the image inL2L_2terms? This section implements an evaluation function that tracks
accuracy, success rate, confidence drop, and perturbation norms, giving
a complete picture of attack impact.



## What Metrics Do We Need?



Evaluating an adversarial attack requires looking beyond whether
predictions flip. We need to understand the full impact on model
behavior. Accuracy metrics tell us how many samples the model classifies
correctly before and after perturbation, establishing the baseline and
measuring degradation. Success rate specifically measures what
percentage of originally correct predictions the attack manages to flip,
isolating attack effectiveness from model quality. Confidence metrics
reveal how certain the model is in its predictions, showing whether the
attack creates genuine confusion or just barely pushes samples across
decision boundaries. Perturbation norms quantify the distortion
introduced, measuring both averageL2L_2distance per sample and maximumL∞L_\inftychange to verify we respect the epsilon budget.



## Building the Evaluation Function

First, we need the model's predictions and confidence scores for both clean and adversarial inputs. Running both batches through the model yields logits, which we convert to probabilities using softmax and extract predicted classes using argmax:

Code:python```
`fromtypingimportDictdefevaluate_attack(model:nn.Module,clean_images:Tensor,adversarial_images:Tensor,true_labels:Tensor)->Dict[str,float]:"""Compute accuracy, success rate, confidence shift, and norms.

    Args:
        model: Evaluated classifier in evaluation mode
        clean_images: Clean inputs in the model's expected domain (e.g., normalized MNIST)
        adversarial_images: Adversarial counterparts in the same domain as `clean_images`
        true_labels: Ground-truth labels

    Returns:
        Dict[str, float]: Aggregated metrics summarizing attack impact
    """model.eval()withtorch.no_grad():clean_logits=model(clean_images)adv_logits=model(adversarial_images)clean_probs=F.softmax(clean_logits,dim=1)adv_probs=F.softmax(adv_logits,dim=1)clean_pred=clean_logits.argmax(dim=1)adv_pred=adv_logits.argmax(dim=1)`
```

The`torch.no_grad()`context disables gradient tracking since we're only evaluating, not training. For a batch of 128 images with 10 classes,`clean_logits`has shape`[128, 10]`,`clean_probs`has the same shape with rows summing to 1.0, and`clean_pred`has shape`[128]`containing class indices.

### Measuring Accuracy and Success Rate

Next, we compute correctness masks and derive the attack success rate. Comparing predictions to true labels yields boolean tensors indicating which samples are classified correctly. The attack success rate focuses specifically on samples that were originally correct but became incorrect after perturbation:

Code:python```
`clean_correct=(clean_pred==true_labels)adv_correct=(adv_pred==true_labels)originally_correct=clean_correct
        flipped=(~adv_correct)&originally_correct`
```



The`flipped`mask uses logical operations to identify
samples where`clean_correct`is`True`but`adv_correct`is`False`. If 125 out of 128
samples were originally correct and 80 flipped, the success rate is80/125=0.6480/125 = 0.64.



### Extracting Confidence Metrics



Confidence metrics reveal how certain the model is in its
predictions. We extract the probability the model assigns to the true
class for each sample, both before and after perturbation. The`gather`operation selects specific probability values based
on the true label indices:



Code:python```
`conf_clean=clean_probs.gather(1,true_labels.view(-1,1)).squeeze(1)conf_adv=adv_probs.gather(1,true_labels.view(-1,1)).squeeze(1)`
```

How does`gather`work? If`true_labels=[3, 7]`and`clean_probs`has shape`[2, 10]`, then`true_labels.view(-1, 1)`reshapes to`[[3], [7]]`. The`gather(1, ...)`operation selects column 3 from row 0 and column 7 from row 1, extracting the probabilities for the true classes. The`squeeze(1)`removes the extra dimension, yielding a 1D tensor. A confidence drop from 0.92 to 0.31 indicates the attack eroded the model's certainty by 61 percentage points, even if the prediction didn't flip.

### Computing Perturbation Norms



Finally, we measure the magnitude of perturbations introduced by the
attack. TheL2L_2norm quantifies the Euclidean distance between clean and adversarial
images (measuring overall distortion), while theL∞L_\inftynorm captures the maximum change to any single pixel (verifying we
respect the epsilon budget):



Code:python```
`l2=(adversarial_images-clean_images).view(clean_images.size(0),-1).norm(p=2,dim=1)linf=(adversarial_images-clean_images).abs().amax()return{"clean_accuracy":clean_correct.float().mean().item(),"adversarial_accuracy":adv_correct.float().mean().item(),# Success rate among originally correct samples only"attack_success_rate":(flipped.float().sum()/originally_correct.float().sum().clamp_min(1.0)).item(),"avg_clean_confidence":conf_clean.mean().item(),"avg_adv_confidence":conf_adv.mean().item(),"avg_confidence_drop":(conf_clean-conf_adv).mean().item(),"avg_l2_perturbation":l2.mean().item(),"max_linf_perturbation":linf.item(),}`
```



The`.view(clean_images.size(0), -1)`flattens each image
to a 1D vector while preserving the batch dimension, enabling per-sampleL2L_2norm computation. For MNIST images with shape`[128, 1, 28, 28]`, this becomes`[128, 784]`. The`norm(p=2, dim=1)`computes theL2L_2norm along dimension 1, yielding a tensor of shape`[128]`with one norm value per image. TheL∞L_\inftynorm uses`.amax()`without specifying dimensions, returning
the single largest absolute perturbation across the entire batch.



## Applying the Metrics

Applying these metrics to the batch from Core Implementation:

Code:python```
`# Assume images, labels, x_adv from the Core Implementation sectionmetrics=evaluate_attack(model,images,x_adv,labels)fork,vinmetrics.items():print(f"{k}:{v:.4f}")`
```

Expected output:

Code:txt```
`clean_accuracy: 0.9766
adversarial_accuracy: 0.3203
attack_success_rate: 0.6797
avg_clean_confidence: 0.9824
avg_adv_confidence: 0.3891
avg_confidence_drop: 0.5933
avg_l2_perturbation: 10.8451
max_linf_perturbation: 0.8000`
```



The metrics show that FGSM with`epsilon=0.8`(in
normalized space, approximately`epsilon=0.25`in pixel
space) successfully flips 67.97% of originally correct predictions,
dropping average confidence from 98.24% to 38.91%. The`max_linf_perturbation`confirms the attack respects the
epsilon bound. TheL2L_2perturbation of approximately 10.8 reflects the normalized space
magnitude, which corresponds to subtle visual changes when denormalized
for display.
