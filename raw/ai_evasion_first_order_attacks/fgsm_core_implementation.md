# Core Implementation

Before building the attack, we need a clean foundation. We assume you have the required libraries imported, a trained`SimpleCNN`, a`test_loader`, and a configured`device`from the setup section. The implementation uses PyTorch for tensor operations and automatic differentiation, along with the visualization tools and HTB styling constants already available from previous sections.

## Computing Loss Without Side Effects

Separating forward computation and loss calculation into a small helper keeps gradient flow scoped to the input tensor and makes debugging simpler. This helper assumes the model is already in evaluation mode to avoid state updates from batch normalization or dropout. Keeping the function free of graph‑modifying side effects lets us reuse it wherever a clean loss value is needed:

Code:python```
`def_forward_and_loss(model:nn.Module,x:Tensor,y:Tensor)->tuple[Tensor,Tensor]:"""Forward pass and cross-entropy loss without side effects.

    Args:
        model: Neural network classifier
        x: Input images tensor
        y: Target labels tensor

    Returns:
        tuple[Tensor, Tensor]: Model logits and scalar loss value
    """ifgetattr(model,"training",False):raiseRuntimeError("Expected model.eval() for attack computations to avoid BN/Dropout state updates")logits=model(x)loss=F.cross_entropy(logits,y)returnlogits,loss`
```

What do the shapes look like? For a batch of 128 MNIST images,`x`arrives with shape`[128, 1, 28, 28]`(batch size, channels, height, width). The model outputs`logits`of shape`[128, 10]`, one row per image with 10 class scores. Cross-entropy reduces these to a single scalar`loss`value. Returning both logits and loss gives callers flexibility: sometimes you need predictions, sometimes just the loss, sometimes both.

## Gradient Computation

As established in the FGSM theory section, adversarial attacks require computing gradients with respect to inputs rather than parameters. Here's the PyTorch implementation:

Code:python```
`def_input_gradient(model:nn.Module,x:Tensor,y:Tensor)->Tensor:"""Return gradient of loss with respect to input tensor x.

    Args:
        model: Neural network in evaluation mode
        x: Input images to compute gradients for
        y: True labels for loss computation

    Returns:
        Tensor: Gradient tensor with same shape as x
    """x_req=x.clone().detach().requires_grad_(True)_,loss=_forward_and_loss(model,x_req,y)model.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)loss.backward()returnx_req.grad.detach()`
```



The implementation details:`x.clone().detach()`creates a
new tensor disconnected from the computational history. The`.requires_grad_(True)`enables gradient tracking on the
input. When`loss.backward()`executes, PyTorch computes∇xℒ\nabla_x \mathcal{L}and stores it in`x_req.grad`. The final`.detach()`returns a standalone gradient tensor. Shape is
preserved automatically: a`[128, 1, 28, 28]`input produces
a`[128, 1, 28, 28]`gradient.



## Core FGSM Attack Implementation



With gradients in hand, the attack becomes almost trivial. Extract
the sign, scale byϵ\epsilon,
add to the image, and clip. Four operations implement the entire
attack:



Code:python```
`deffgsm_attack(model:nn.Module,images:Tensor,labels:Tensor,epsilon:float,targeted:bool=False)->Tensor:# Valid normalized range for MNISTMNIST_NORM_MIN=(0.0-0.1307)/0.3081MNIST_NORM_MAX=(1.0-0.1307)/0.3081ifepsilon<0:raiseValueError("epsilon must be non-negative")ifnotimages.is_floating_point():raiseValueError("images must be floating point tensors")grad=_input_gradient(model,images,labels)step_dir=-1.0iftargetedelse1.0x_adv=images+step_dir*epsilon*grad.sign()x_adv=torch.clamp(x_adv,MNIST_NORM_MIN,MNIST_NORM_MAX)returnx_adv.detach()`
```



PyTorch’s`.sign()`method operates element-wise on
tensors, preserving shape and device placement. For a gradient tensor of
shape`[128, 1, 28, 28]`on GPU,`grad.sign()`returns another`[128, 1, 28, 28]`tensor on the same GPU
with identical memory layout. The operation is computationally cheap
(single pass, no sorting or reduction) and memory-efficient (no
intermediate allocations beyond the output tensor). The multiplication`epsilon * grad.sign()`broadcasts the scalar`epsilon`across all tensor elements, creating the
perturbationδ\deltawhere each component has magnitude exactly`epsilon`(or zero
if the gradient was exactly zero, which rarely occurs with
floating-point arithmetic).



The scalar`step_dir`controls attack direction through multiplication. Setting`step_dir=1.0`for untargeted attacks means the perturbation`step_dir * epsilon * grad.sign()`adds to the image, while`step_dir=-1.0`for targeted attacks subtracts. This avoids duplicating the gradient computation logic. The`torch.clamp()`operation clips adversarial images to the valid normalized range for MNIST (approximately -0.424 to 2.821), preventing grey washout when denormalized for visualization. This range corresponds to [0,1] in pixel space after applying the inverse normalization transform. Clamping happens element-wise, and the final`.detach()`extracts the adversarial images without gradient tracking.

## Testing the Attack

Does FGSM actually work? Let's grab a batch, attack it, and count how many predictions flip. The test focuses on samples the model originally classified correctly, since flipping an already-wrong prediction tells us nothing:

Code:python```
`images,labels=next(iter(test_loader))images,labels=images.to(device),labels.to(device)model.eval()# Epsilon in normalized space (≈0.25 in pixel space)epsilon=0.8withtorch.no_grad():clean_pred=model(images).argmax(dim=1)x_adv=fgsm_attack(model,images,labels,epsilon)withtorch.no_grad():adv_pred=model(x_adv).argmax(dim=1)originally_correct=(clean_pred==labels)flipped=(adv_pred!=labels)&originally_correct
success=flipped.sum().item()/max(int(originally_correct.sum().item()),1)print(f"FGSM flips (first batch):{success:.2%}")`
```

Expected output:

Code:txt```
`FGSM flips (first batch): 71.09%`
```



How should we interpret a 71.09% flip rate? Out of 128 samples in the
batch, if 128 were originally correct and 91 flipped, the success rate
would be91/128≈0.710991/128 \approx 0.7109.
This run usesϵ=0.8\epsilon=0.8in normalized MNIST space. With mean0.13070.1307and std0.30810.3081,
this maps to approximately0.8×0.3081≈0.250.8 \times 0.3081 \approx 0.25in[0,1][0,1]pixel space, about0.25×255≈640.25 \times 255 \approx 64intensity levels at 8-bit precision. The exact flip rate varies with the
trained weights and the specific batch.



## Pixel-Space FGSM Variant

The core FGSM implementation works entirely in normalized space: it expects images already normalized, uses epsilon in normalized units, and returns adversarials in normalized space. This matches our setup where`get_mnist_loaders(normalize=True)`provides pre-normalized batches. However, some workflows start with raw pixel-space images in`[0,1]`and need epsilon specified as pixel-space perturbations (like "8/255 intensity levels").



For these pixel-space workflows attacking normalized models, we need
a variant that accepts`[0,1]`images, interpretsϵ\epsilonas a pixel-space budget, but still normalizes internally for the model
and converts gradients correctly. The key is dividing normalized-space
gradients byσ\sigmato map them back to pixel space before applying the sign step with the
pixel-spaceϵ\epsilon.





Why the conversion? When gradients are computed with respect to
normalized inputsxnorm=(x−μ)/σx_{\text{norm}} = (x - \mu)/\sigma,
those gradients live in normalized space. To apply a pixel-space epsilon
budget, we must convert gradients back using the chain rule:∇xℒ=∇xnormℒ/σ\nabla_x \mathcal{L} = \nabla_{x_{\text{norm}}} \mathcal{L} / \sigma.
This ensures`epsilon=0.031`(approximately 8/255) means
exactly 8 intensity levels in original`[0,1]`space, not in
the stretched normalized space where magnitudes differ by a factor ofσ\sigma.



### Creating Normalization Parameters

Before implementing the pixel-space FGSM variant, we need a helper function to prepare normalization parameters as broadcastable tensors matching image batch dimensions. The normalization transform requires mean and standard deviation values, but we receive them as Python lists. Converting them to properly shaped tensors ensures they broadcast correctly across batch, height, and width dimensions when normalizing images:

Code:python```
`def_norm_params(images:Tensor,mean:list,std:list)->tuple[Tensor,Tensor]:"""Convert normalization parameters to broadcastable tensors.

    Args:
        images: Input images tensor with shape (N, C, H, W)
        mean: Normalization mean per channel as list
        std: Normalization std per channel as list

    Returns:
        tuple[Tensor, Tensor]: Mean and std tensors with shape (1, C, 1, 1)
    """device,dtype,C=images.device,images.dtype,images.shape[1]mean_t=torch.tensor(mean,device=device,dtype=dtype).view(1,-1,1,1)std_t=torch.tensor(std,device=device,dtype=dtype).view(1,-1,1,1)ifmean_t.shape[1]!=Corstd_t.shape[1]!=C:raiseValueError("mean/std channels must match images")returnmean_t,std_t`
```

The`.view(1, -1, 1, 1)`reshapes the mean/std vectors for broadcasting. For RGB images with`mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]`, the tensor shape becomes`[1, 3, 1, 1]`, broadcasting across batch, height, and width dimensions.

### Pixel-Space FGSM Implementation



How do we bridge pixel-space inputs with normalized models while
keeping epsilon interpretable? The implementation needs to handle a
tricky dance: accept`[0,1]`images, transform them to
normalized space for the model’s gradient computation, then transform
those gradients back to pixel space so our pixel-space epsilon has
correct meaning. The key challenge is the gradient conversion step,
where we must divide byσ\sigmato undo the scaling that normalization introduced. Without this step,
applying a pixel-space epsilon to normalized-space gradients produces
incorrect perturbation magnitudes.



Code:python```
`deffgsm_pixel_space(model:nn.Module,images:Tensor,labels:Tensor,epsilon:float,mean:list,std:list,targeted:bool=False)->Tensor:"""FGSM for pixel-space inputs attacking normalized models.

    This variant accepts images in [0,1] pixel space rather than normalized
    space. It normalizes inputs internally for the model, converts gradients
    back to pixel space, and returns adversarials in [0,1] pixel space.

    Args:
        model: Model expecting normalized inputs
        images: Clean images in [0,1] pixel space (unnormalized)
        labels: Target labels
        epsilon: Max perturbation in pixel space (e.g., 8/255)
        mean: Normalization mean per channel
        std: Normalization std per channel
        targeted: If True, minimize loss towards labels

    Returns:
        Tensor: Adversarial images in [0,1] pixel space (unnormalized)
    """mean_t,std_t=_norm_params(images,mean,std)x=images.clone().detach()x_norm=(x-mean_t)/std_t
    x_norm.requires_grad_(True)_,loss=_forward_and_loss(model,x_norm,labels)model.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)loss.backward()# Convert gradient from normalized space to image spacegrad_img=x_norm.grad/std_t
    step_dir=-1.0iftargetedelse1.0x_adv=torch.clamp(x+step_dir*epsilon*grad_img.sign(),0.0,1.0)returnx_adv.detach()`
```



Why divide by`std_t`? The normalization(x−μ)/σ(x - \mu)/\sigmascales pixel values. Gradients computed with respect to the normalized
inputxnormx_{\text{norm}}live in that scaled space. To interpret`epsilon`as a bound
in the original [0,1] pixel space, we must undo the scaling. If`std=[0.229]`and the normalized-space gradient is 2.5, the
image-space gradient becomes2.5/0.229≈10.92.5 / 0.229 \approx 10.9.
The sign step then uses this rescaled gradient, ensuringϵ=8/255≈0.031\epsilon=8/255 \approx 0.031means exactly 8 intensity levels in the original image, not 8 levels in
the normalized space where magnitudes differ.



### When to Use This Variant

This pixel-space variant is useful when working with pipelines that provide raw unnormalized images but you need to attack a model expecting normalized inputs. For example, some datasets or external APIs return images in`[0,1]`without normalization applied.

However, if your data is already normalized (as with our`get_mnist_loaders(normalize=True)`setup), you should use the core`fgsm_attack`directly, which operates entirely in normalized space. Converting normalized → pixel → attack → normalized is unnecessarily complex.



For workflows requiring this variant: if images arrive in`[0,1]`, specifyϵ\epsilonin pixel units (like8/255≈0.0318/255 \approx 0.031),
and the function handles the internal normalization and gradient
conversion automatically:



Code:python```
`# Example: Starting with pixel-space imagesepsilon_px=8/255# pixel-space epsilon (≈0.031)mean,std=[0.1307],[0.3081]# Denormalize existing normalized images to get pixel-space imagesmean_t,std_t=_norm_params(images,mean,std)pixel_images=images*std_t+mean_t
pixel_images=torch.clamp(pixel_images,0.0,1.0)# Attack in pixel spacex_adv_pixel=fgsm_pixel_space(model,pixel_images,labels,epsilon_px,mean,std)# x_adv_pixel is in [0,1] and can be displayed or saved directly# If you need to pass to the model again, normalize it first:x_adv_norm=(x_adv_pixel-mean_t)/std_t`
```



The function ensuresϵ\epsilonretains its pixel-space interpretation throughout the attack by
converting gradients via division byσ\sigmabefore applying the sign step. This keeps perturbation budgets
meaningful when comparing across different normalization schemes.
