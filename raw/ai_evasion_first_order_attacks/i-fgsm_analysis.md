# I-FGSM Analysis

Beyond basic implementation and testing, understanding how I-FGSM behaves across different configurations reveals optimization trade-offs. This section explores visualization, hyperparameter effects, the relationship to PGD, targeted variants, and direct comparisons with single-step FGSM.

## Visualization

To see how I-FGSM modifies images visually, let's reuse the visualization infrastructure from the Visualization section. This displays clean and adversarial images side by side, along with the scaled perturbation and class probability shifts.

Code:python```
`defvisualize_ifgsm(model:nn.Module,image:Tensor,label:Tensor,epsilon:float,num_iter:int,targeted:bool=False,target_class:int|None=None)->None:"""Wrapper for visualize_attack using I-FGSM.

    Args:
        model: Classifier model
        image: Single image tensor [C,H,W]
        label: True label
        epsilon: Perturbation budget
        num_iter: Number of iterations
        targeted: If True, targeted attack
        target_class: Target class for targeted attacks

```

The visualization reveals how iterative refinement often achieves cleaner adversarial examples than single-step FGSM. The perturbation appears more structured, focusing on regions most sensitive to the model's decision.

## Step Size, Iterations, and Random Starts



Choosingα\alphaandTTbalances speed and strength. The defaultα=ϵT\alpha = \tfrac{\epsilon}{T}keeps the worst-case per-pixel change within the budget while allowing
sufficient refinement.





Consider these trade-offs with specific numbers. With large alpha and
few iterations (sayα=0.1\alpha=0.1andT=2T=2),
the method moves quickly but may overshoot optimal adversarials. Loss
changes might show rapid jumps: 0.3 → 0.9 → 1.1. By contrast, small
alpha with many iterations (such asα=0.01\alpha=0.01andT=20T=20)
refines gradually, producing smooth loss evolution: 0.3 → 0.35 → 0.41 →
... → 1.45. The gradual path often finds stronger adversarials because
it tracks the curved loss surface more accurately.





Random starts add another dimension. Adding uniform noiseδ∈[−ϵ,ϵ]\delta \in [-\epsilon, \epsilon]before iterating explores different paths through the loss landscape.
This exploration can increase success rate from 85% to 92% at the same
budget, demonstrating how initialization affects final outcomes. In
practice, random starts turn near-misses into successes by escaping
local neighborhoods where the gradient points nowhere useful.



## Relation to PGD



Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), formalized by Madry et al. in
Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks (2017)
"linked below", is the general form of iterative attacks under
constraints. With the sign step,α=ϵT\alpha = \tfrac{\epsilon}{T},
and optional random restarts, the implementation above coincides with
the common BIM/PGD settings for theL∞L_\inftythreat model.



[Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083)



The relationship becomes clear when comparing update rules. I-FGSM
uses the updatex(t+1)=ΠB∞(x(t)+α⋅sign(∇L))x^{(t+1)} = \Pi_{B_\infty}(x^{(t)} + \alpha \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla L))to iteratively refine adversarial examples. PGD uses the same update but
potentially includes multiple random restarts to explore different
initialization points. BIM is essentially identical to I-FGSM but
traditionally refers to the version without random initialization.



Random restarts further increase reliability by escaping poor local optima while keeping the same budget. Conceptually, PGD is I-FGSM plus a randomized initialization and, optionally, multiple attempts that keep the strongest adversarial found.

## Targeted Iterative FGSM



Building directly on the targeted FGSM formulation, the iterative
variant applies the same two changes (swap the label in the loss to the
desired targetyty_tand reverse the step direction) but repeats them with projection after
each step.



The per-iteration update becomes:



x(t+1)=Πℬ∞(x,ϵ)(x(t)−αsign⁡(∇x(t)ℒ(θ,x(t),yt))),x^{(t+1)} = \Pi_{\mathcal{B}_\infty(x,\epsilon)}\big(x^{(t)} - \alpha\,\operatorname{sign}(\nabla_{x^{(t)}}\,\mathcal{L}(\theta, x^{(t)}, y_t))\big),





This mirrors untargeted I-FGSM except for usingyty_tin the gradient and the minus sign. The targeted objective generally
needs more iterations or slightly largerϵ\epsilon,
and benefits from smallerα\alphawith more steps, random starts, and early stopping once the model
predictsyty_t.



### Targeted Attack Example

Let's force a specific misclassification: turning a 1 into a 7. The attack supplies the target label 7 in the loss computation and reverses the update direction:

Code:python```
`# Find one sample of '1'one_img,one_lbl=None,Noneforxb,ybintest_loader:m=(yb==1)ifm.any():j=m.nonzero(as_tuple=True)[0][0].item()one_img=xb[j].to(device)one_lbl=yb[j].to(device)break# Try increasing epsilon values until successfulforeps_tryin[0.5,0.8,1.0]:x_adv=iterative_fgsm(model,one_img.unsqueeze(0),torch.tensor(7,device=device).unsqueeze(0),# target labelepsilon=eps_try,num_iter=num_iter,alpha=eps_try/max(num_iter,1),targeted=True,random_start=True,)withtorch.no_grad():pred=model(x_adv).argmax(dim=1).item()print(f"epsilon={eps_try:.2f}-> predicted{pred}")ifpred==7:_=visualize_ifgsm(model,one_img.detach().cpu(),one_lbl.detach().cpu(),eps_try,num_iter,targeted=True,target_class=7,)break`
```

Expected output:

Code:txt```
`epsilon=0.50 -> predicted 1
epsilon=0.80 -> predicted 7`
```

The loop progressively increases epsilon until the target is achieved. In this case,`epsilon=0.5`fails to achieve the target, with the prediction remaining at 1. Increasing to`epsilon=0.8`successfully achieves the target prediction 7. The visualization then shows the successful targeted attack. Note that I-FGSM achieves the targeted misclassification with a smaller epsilon (0.8 in normalized space) compared to FGSM which required epsilon=1.0, demonstrating the advantage of iterative refinement even for targeted attacks.

## Comparison: FGSM vs I-FGSM

To demonstrate the improvement from iteration, both methods are compared on the same batch:

Code:python```
`# Compare FGSM (one-step) and I-FGSM on the same batch# Run both attacks with same epsilonepsilon=0.7x_adv_fgsm=fgsm_attack(model,images,labels,epsilon)x_adv_ifgsm=iterative_fgsm(model,images,labels,epsilon,num_iter=10,random_start=True)# Compare success rateswithtorch.no_grad():fgsm_pred=model(x_adv_fgsm).argmax(dim=1)ifgsm_pred=model(x_adv_ifgsm).argmax(dim=1)orig_correct=clean_pred==labels
fgsm_success=(((fgsm_pred!=labels)&orig_correct).float().sum()/orig_correct.float().sum().clamp_min(1.0))ifgsm_success=(((ifgsm_pred!=labels)&orig_correct).float().sum()/orig_correct.float().sum().clamp_min(1.0))print(f"FGSM success rate:{fgsm_success:.1%}")print(f"I-FGSM success rate:{ifgsm_success:.1%}")print(f"Improvement:{(ifgsm_success-fgsm_success)/fgsm_success:.1%}")`
```

Expected output:

Code:txt```
`FGSM success rate: 57.8%
I-FGSM success rate: 95.3%
Improvement: 64.9%`
```



These results show I-FGSM achieving 95.3% success where FGSM achieves
57.8%, a 64.9% relative improvement at the sameL∞L_\inftybudget ofϵ=0.7\epsilon=0.7in normalized space. Iterative refinement better exploits the loss
landscape within the same perturbation constraints, while both methods
respect the identical per-pixel bound.
