# Batch Attack Generation

The single-image demonstration showed DeepFool's ability to find minimal perturbations. One sample. One perturbation. One data point. What patterns emerge when attacking multiple samples? Does perturbation size vary by digit class? Which samples resist attacks most strongly, and which crumble immediately? Batch analysis across diverse inputs exposes statistical patterns completely invisible in single examples, transforming anecdotal observations into quantitative measurements.

## Systematic Sample Processing

Single-sample attacks provide proof of concept, but statistical patterns require population-level analysis. Does DeepFool consistently converge in similar iteration counts? Do all digit classes exhibit comparable robustness? Which decision boundaries require larger perturbations? We need to attack multiple diverse samples while tracking metrics for each: perturbation norms, iteration counts, success indicators, and classification trajectories. The batch processing infrastructure will generate this dataset for statistical analysis.

### Establishing the Batch Attack Pipeline

Our goal is processing many samples efficiently while preserving per-sample metrics. Why not use larger batches? DeepFool's iterative nature makes each sample independent: one may converge in 2 iterations while another requires 6. Batch processing would force all samples to wait for the slowest, wasting computation. We'll process 20 samples individually to balance statistical insight with runtime, accumulating results in a structured format for downstream analysis.

Code:python```
`num_examples=20print(f"\nGenerating{num_examples}adversarial examples using DeepFool...")_,test_loader=get_mnist_loaders(batch_size=1,normalize=True)model.eval()results=[]success_count=0print(f"Test loader ready with{len(test_loader.dataset)}samples")print(f"Will process first{num_examples}samples")print("Starting batch attack generation...")`
```

The single-sample batches enable independent processing where each attack terminates immediately upon convergence without waiting for others. The`results`list accumulates dictionaries containing both tensor data (images, perturbations) and scalar metrics (norms, iteration counts). The`success_count`tracks classification flips separately for quick summary statistics. Processing 20 samples takes roughly 1-2 seconds on GPU (50-100ms per sample), sufficient to expose patterns without extensive wait times.

### Executing Attacks and Collecting Metrics

Each sample must be attacked independently, with metrics captured for statistical analysis. We need to store not just success/failure, but the complete trajectory: how many iterations were required, what perturbation magnitude was needed, whether the original prediction was correct, and what the adversarial label became. This rich dataset enables answering questions about convergence patterns, robustness variation across classes, and boundary geometry characteristics. The processing loop must also provide real-time feedback so we can monitor attack effectiveness as samples are processed.

Code:python```
`foridx,(data,target)inenumerate(test_loader):ifidx>=num_examples:breakdata=data.to(device)# Execute DeepFool attackr,iterations,orig_label,adv_label,pert_image=deepfool(data,model,num_classes=10,overshoot=0.02,max_iter=50,device=device)# Track success and store metricssuccess=(orig_label!=adv_label)ifsuccess:success_count+=1results.append({'original_image':data.cpu(),'perturbation':r.cpu(),'perturbed_image':pert_image.cpu(),'original_label':orig_label,'adversarial_label':adv_label,'iterations':iterations,'true_label':target.item(),'l2_norm':torch.norm(r.cpu()).item(),'success':success})# Progress feedbackprint(f"  Example{idx+1}: True={target.item()}, Orig={orig_label}, "f"Adv={adv_label}, Iter={iterations}, L2={torch.norm(r.cpu()).item():.4f}")`
```



The results dictionary captures nine distinct measurements per
sample. Tensor data (`original_image`,`perturbation`,`perturbed_image`) gets
transferred to CPU immediately via`.cpu()`to free GPU
memory, preventing accumulation that would cause out-of-memory errors
after processing dozens of samples. TheL2L_2norm computation`torch.norm(r.cpu()).item()`measures total
perturbation energy, with`.item()`converting from a
single-element tensor to a Python float for storage. The progress print
exposes patterns as they emerge: some samples flip with iterations of
1-2 andL2L_2norms around 2-3 (well-separated classes), while others require 5-6
iterations withL2L_2norms of 8-10 (ambiguous boundaries).



### Summarizing Attack Statistics



What does the population-level data show? We need aggregate
statistics quantifying overall attack success, average perturbation
magnitude, and typical convergence speed. These summary metrics enable
comparing DeepFool’s behavior across different models, architectures, or
datasets. The success rate indicates reliability, averageL2L_2norm quantifies typical robustness, and average iteration count measures
convergence efficiency.



Code:python```
`print(f"\nAttack Success Rate:{success_count}/{num_examples}"f"({100*success_count/num_examples:.1f}%)")print(f"Average L2 norm:{np.mean([r['l2_norm']forrinresults]):.4f}")print(f"Average iterations:{np.mean([r['iterations']forrinresults]):.1f}")`
```

Expected output:

Code:txt```
`Attack Success Rate: 20/20 (100.0%)
Average L2 norm: 4.8661
Average iterations: 3.0`
```



The 100% success rate confirms DeepFool’s reliability on
well-separated MNIST classes. The averageL2L_2norm of 4.87 represents typical perturbation magnitude across diverse
digit samples. The 3.0 average iterations indicate most samples converge
in 2-4 steps, with variation between fast convergers (1 iteration for
well-separated classes like ’3→5’) and slower ones (5 iterations for
structurally similar classes like ’4→7’). Individual variation spans
fromL2L_2= 0.60 (digit ’3’ to ’5’, structurally similar) toL2L_2= 7.72 (digit ’7’ to ’2’, requiring significant structural changes).
This 13x range demonstrates how decision boundary geometry varies widely
across different regions of the input space, with some digit pairs
separated by narrow gaps while others require substantial
modifications.



## Visualizing Population-Level Attack Patterns

Statistics quantify attack effectiveness, but visual inspection demonstrates the human-perceptibility of minimal perturbations. Do adversarial examples look obviously corrupted, or do the changes remain subtle enough to avoid casual detection? We need a grid comparing multiple original-adversarial pairs side-by-side, enabling visual assessment of perturbation subtlety across different digit classes. The visualization should highlight successful attacks (classification changed) versus failures (classification unchanged), using our normal themeing. This provides qualitative validation of how minimal DeepFool's perturbations actually are.

Code:python```
`defvisualize_attack_grid(results,save_dir='output'):"""

![Grid comparing MNIST digits before and after DeepFool, with original labels on top rows and adversarial labels like 7→2 and 0→6 in the bottom rows.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/319/deepfool_examples.png)

The grid layout uses integer division and modulo arithmetic for positioning:`row = idx // 5`determines which pair of rows (0 or 1, since each pair shows original/adversarial), while`col = idx % 5`determines the column position (0-4). Each original image occupies`axes[row * 2, col]`, and its adversarial counterpart sits directly below at`axes[row * 2 + 1, col]`. This pairing enables direct visual comparison per sample. Red titles (`MALWARE_RED`) mark successful classification flips, while grey titles indicate failures (rare on MNIST). The paired images demonstrate DeepFool's minimality: on MNIST's simple grayscale digits, careful inspection may reveal subtle differences, but they are only particularly obvious given the high contrast nature of the MNIST dataset (white on black). Examples like '7' flipped to '2', '9' to '4', and '5' to '6' maintain recognizable digit structure while completely fooling the classifier. On complex natural images (like photographs), such minimal perturbations would be nearly impossible to detect with the human eye.
