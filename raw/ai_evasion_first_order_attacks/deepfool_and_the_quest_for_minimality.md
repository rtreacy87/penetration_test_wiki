# DeepFool and the Quest for Minimality



The`Fast Gradient Sign Method`demonstrated efficient
adversarial generation through a single gradient step. One backward
pass. One step along the gradient sign. Adversarial example generated.
Yet FGSM operates within a predetermined perturbation budgetϵ\epsilon,
treating all pixels equally regardless of how much each actually
contributes to changing the decision. The perturbations FGSM produces,
while effective, are not necessarily minimal.



What is the smallest perturbation needed to fool a neural network? This question cuts to the heart of adversarial robustness. The answer matters. Smaller perturbations evade detection more easily, transfer more reliably between models, and provide tighter bounds on a model's true robustness, moving from approximate measures to precise geometric measurements.

`DeepFool`emerged in 2016 as an answer to this challenge. The algorithm, introduced by Moosavi-Dezfooli, Fawzi, and Frossard at CVPR 2016, treats adversarial example generation as a geometric problem: find the shortest path from a data point to the closest decision boundary.

## From Fixed Budgets to Minimal Perturbations



The transition from FGSM’s fixed-budget approach to DeepFool’s
minimal-perturbation philosophy represents a clear shift in attack
design. FGSM asks "given a hammer of sizeϵ\epsilon,
where should I strike?" DeepFool asks something entirely different:
"what is the smallest hammer that will break this?" The contrast exposes
competing philosophies. FGSM maximizes damage within a fixedL∞L_\inftybudgetϵ\epsilon,
operating under predetermined constraints. DeepFool minimizes the budget
needed to achieve misclassification, discovering constraints rather than
imposing them.





Consider the`perturbation budget`ϵ\epsilonin FGSM. Setting this value requires prior knowledge or assumptions
about the model’s vulnerability. Too small? The attack fails. Too large?
The perturbation becomes detectable or destroys semantic meaning. The
choice ofϵ\epsilonbecomes a hyperparameter that conflates the attack method with the
model’s actual robustness, mixing measurement with methodology. Two
models might appear equally robust under one choice ofϵ\epsilonbut show markedly different vulnerabilities whenϵ\epsilonchanges, demonstrating that the robustness measure depends more on
parameter selection than on true model characteristics.



DeepFool eliminates this arbitrary choice entirely. By finding the`minimal sufficient perturbation`for each input individually, the resulting perturbation magnitude becomes a direct measurement of that input's robustness, not a reflection of parameter choices. This shift transforms adversarial attacks from destruction tools into measurement instruments, providing a principled way to compare robustness across different models, architectures, and even different inputs within the same model.

## Mathematical Foundations



Recall from the FGSM exploration that neural networks partition the
input space into regions, with`decision boundaries`separating different classes. FGSM moves perpendicular to these
boundaries in theL∞L_\inftysense, taking the largest allowed step. A different question asks for
the shortest path to any boundary, regardless of direction.



What does the geometry of these boundaries show about minimal perturbations? Decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces have specific properties that DeepFool exploits. While we often visualize decision boundaries as curves or surfaces in 2D or 3D, in the high-dimensional spaces where real neural networks operate (thousands to millions of dimensions for image classifiers), these boundaries form complex`manifolds`. The distance from any point to the nearest boundary varies widely depending on direction. Some directions might require traversing large distances to reach a boundary, while others might encounter one almost immediately.

### Linear Classifiers and Optimal Projections



For a binary linear classifierf(x)=wTx+bf(x) = w^T x + b,
finding the minimalL2L_2perturbation is straightforward. The classifier computes a score by
taking a weighted sum of all input features
(wTxw^T xmeans multiply each feature by its corresponding weight and sum them)
plus a bias termbb.
When this score is positive, the classifier predicts one class; when
negative, it predicts the other. The decision boundary is the hyperplane
wheref(x)=0f(x) = 0,
the exact surface where the classifier is perfectly undecided between
the two classes.





To find the shortest distance from a pointx0x_0to this hyperplane, we use a formula from geometry:





d=|f(x0)|||w||2d = \frac{|f(x_0)|}{||w||_2}





Think of this formula as a fraction with two parts. The numerator|f(x0)||f(x_0)|is the absolute value of the classifier’s score at the starting point.
If the classifier outputs a score of 10, the point is "10 units" away
from the boundary in the classifier’s internal measurement. The
denominator||w||2||w||_2is the`norm`(the "length") of the weight vector. It
indicates how "steep" the classifier’s decision landscape is. A larger
weight norm means the output changes more rapidly as the input moves, so
a shorter distance is required to reach the boundary.



The minimal perturbation that reaches the boundary is:



r*=−f(x0)||w||22wr^* = -\frac{f(x_0)}{||w||_2^2} w





This formula specifies how to change the input to reach the decision
boundary with the smallest possible change. The vectorwwprovides the direction to move (it points "uphill" in the classifier’s
landscape). The negative sign indicates movement "downhill" toward the
boundary when in the positive region. The fractionf(x0)||w||22\frac{f(x_0)}{||w||_2^2}determines the step size in that direction. The term||w||2||w||_2appears squared in the denominator because it accounts both for
normalization of the direction and for how quickly the landscape
changes.





This formula shows the geometric intuition: we project the point
orthogonally onto the decision boundary. The perturbation scales with
the distance to the boundary
(|f(x0)||f(x_0)|)
and inversely with the gradient magnitude
(||w||22||w||_2^2).
Unlike FGSM’s sign operation that equalizes all pixel changes, this
approach naturally weights each dimension by its importance. If one
pixel has a weight of 10 and another has a weight of 1, the first pixel
will change ten times as much in the perturbation, because it has ten
times the influence on the classification.





The orthogonality of this projection is mathematically optimal. In
theL2L_2norm, the shortest path between a point and a hyperplane is always
perpendicular to that hyperplane. This perpendicular direction aligns
with the gradient of the classifier function,ww,
but unlike FGSM, only taking the sign is avoided. Relative magnitudes
across dimensions are preserved, allowing pixels or features that
strongly influence the classification to change more than those with
weak influence.





The termf(x0)f(x_0)in the numerator represents the`classifier’s confidence`at
the original point. Points classified with high confidence (large|f(x0)||f(x_0)|)
require larger perturbations to flip, while points near the boundary
(small|f(x0)||f(x_0)|)
need only tiny nudges. This relationship between confidence and
robustness seems intuitive, but deep networks often violate this
intuition, showing high confidence on points that are extremely close to
decision boundaries.



### Extending to Deep Networks through Iterative Linearization

Deep networks introduce complexity. Serious complexity. Their decision boundaries are not flat hyperplanes but curved surfaces that fold, twist, and create intricate patterns across thousands of dimensions. How can we find the minimal path to a boundary when we cannot see its global shape? The simple projection formula for linear classifiers breaks down. Why? Linear approximations only hold in tiny neighborhoods around each point, making global calculations impossible.

DeepFool solves this through`iterative linearization`. Think of navigating a curved mountain in dense fog. Only the immediate terrain is visible. At each position, compute the best local direction based on what you can see. Take a small step. Reassess from the new vantage point. Repeat until reaching the boundary. This strategy builds a path incrementally, with each step guided by fresh local information rather than a single global calculation that might miss the boundary's curvature entirely.



The process unfolds through careful local approximations. First,
DeepFool linearizes the classifier around the current point using
first-order Taylor expansion. Think of Taylor expansion as zooming in on
a curved line until it looks straight. If you zoom in close enough on
any smooth curve, it appears linear. For a neural network with outputf(x)f(x)for the true class andg(x)g(x)for an alternative class, the linearization around pointxix_igives usf(x)≈f(xi)+∇f(xi)T(x−xi)f(x) \approx f(x_i) + \nabla f(x_i)^T(x - x_i)and similarly forg(x)g(x).





Breaking this down:f(xi)f(x_i)is the network’s current output,∇f(xi)\nabla f(x_i)is the gradient (which tells how the output changes as each input
feature is modified), and(x−xi)(x - x_i)is the displacement from the current position. The formula essentially
says: "the new output equals the current output plus the rate of change
times the distance moved." This transforms the complex non-linear
decision boundary into a simple hyperplane that approximates the true
boundary near the current location.



What comes next? Compute the minimal perturbation for this linear approximation using the closed-form solution for linear classifiers. This gives the optimal direction and distance to move if the classifier were exactly linear. The key insight is that while this perturbation might not reach the actual non-linear boundary, it moves closer to it in a principled way.

Step size matters critically. Too large, and the algorithm risks overshooting or trusting an inaccurate linear approximation far from the current point. Too small, and convergence crawls. DeepFool typically takes the full computed step, betting on sufficient local linearity near well-trained decision boundaries.

The algorithm re-evaluates the network at the new point and repeats. Each iteration provides a fresh linear approximation at the new location, gradually building a path that follows the boundary's curvature. The iterations continue until the classification changes, signaling successful crossing of the decision boundary.



DeepFool adaptively chooses both direction and magnitude to minimize
the total perturbation. Each iteration refines the path based on the
local geometry, progressively approaching the true non-linear decision
boundary. The accumulated perturbations from all iterations sum to
create the final adversarial perturbation, which approximates the
minimal perturbation needed to cross the non-linear boundary.



This approach is adaptable. In regions where the decision boundary is nearly linear, DeepFool might reach it in a single iteration. In regions of high curvature, it automatically takes more iterations, each adjusting to follow the boundary's contours. This adaptive behavior ensures that the final perturbation remains close to minimal regardless of the local geometry's complexity.
