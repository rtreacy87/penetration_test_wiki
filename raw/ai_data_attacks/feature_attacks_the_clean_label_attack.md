# The Clean Label Attack

---



Having identified the`target point`𝐱target\mathbf{x}_{target},
our next step is to manipulate the training data specifically to cause
its misclassification. We achieve this by subtly shifting the learned`decision boundary`. We will perturb the selected`Class 0`(Blue) data points that are neighbours to the`target point`in order to shift the boundary.





We first need to locate several`Class 0`points residing
closest to𝐱target\mathbf{x}_{target}within the feature space. These neighbours serve as anchors influencing
the boundary’s local position. We then calculate small`perturbations`, denotedδi\delta_i,
for these selected neighbours𝐱i\mathbf{x}_i.
These perturbations are specifically designed to push each neighbour
slightly across the original decision boundary
(f01(𝐱)=0f_{01}(\mathbf{x})=0)
and into the region typically associated with`Class 1`(Yellow). This process yields perturbed points𝐱′i=𝐱i+δi\mathbf{x}'_i = \mathbf{x}_i + \delta_i.





The poisoned training dataset is then created by substituting these
original neighbours𝐱i\mathbf{x}_iwith their perturbed counterparts𝐱′i\mathbf{x}'_i.
Crucially, we assign the original`Class 0`label to these
perturbed points𝐱′i\mathbf{x}'_i,
even though they now sit in the`Class 1`region according to
the baseline model.





When the model retrains on this poisoned data, it encounters a
conflict: points
(𝐱′i\mathbf{x}'_i)
labeled`0`are located where it would expect points labeled`1`. To reconcile this based on the provided (and unchanged)
labels, the model is forced to adjust its decision boundary. Typically,
it pushes the boundaryf01(𝐱)=0f_{01}(\mathbf{x})=0outwards into the original`Class 1`region to correctly
classify the perturbed points𝐱′i\mathbf{x}'_ias`Class 0`. A successful attack occurs when this induced
boundary shift is significant enough to engulf the nearby`target point`𝐱target\mathbf{x}_{target},
causing it to fall on the`Class 0`side of the new
boundary.





Throughout this process, the`perturbations`δi\delta_imust remain small. This subtlety ensures the`Class 0`label
still appears plausible for the altered feature vectors𝐱′i\mathbf{x}'_i,
thus preserving the "clean label" characteristic of the attack where
only features are modified, not labels.



## Attack Implementation



We begin the implementation by finding the required`Class 0`neighbours closest to the`target point`. We use Scikit-learn’s`NearestNeighbors`algorithm, fitting it only on the`Class 0`training data and then querying it with the
coordinates of𝐱target\mathbf{x}_{target}.
We must specify how many neighbours
(`n_neighbors_to_perturb`) to select for modification.



Code:python```
`print("\n--- Identifying Class 0 Neighbors to Perturb ---")n_neighbors_to_perturb=5# Hyperparameter: How many neighbors to modify# Find indices of all Class 0 points in the original training setclass0_indices_train=np.where(y_train_3c==0)[0]iflen(class0_indices_train)==0:raiseValueError("CRITICAL: No Class 0 points found.

This indicates a potential issue in data or logic.")`
```

This has identified the 5 closest Class 0 points to our target:

Code:python```
`---Identifying Class0Neighbors to Perturb---Found350Class0pointsinthe trainingset.Target Point Index:373(TrueClass1)Identified5closest Class0neighbors to perturb:IndicesinX_train_3c:[761821035919491]Distances to target:[0.103180160.122777410.149175830.250811150.30161621]`
```



Having identified the neighbours, we now determine the exact change
(`perturbation`) to apply to each one. The goal is to push
these points
(𝐱i\mathbf{x}_i)
from their original`Class 0`region (wheref01(𝐱i)>0f_{01}(\mathbf{x}_i) > 0)
just across the boundary into the`Class 1`region (wheref01<0f_{01} < 0).





The most direct path across the boundaryf01(𝐱)=(𝐰0−𝐰1)T𝐱+(b0−b1)=0f_{01}(\mathbf{x}) = (\mathbf{w}_0 - \mathbf{w}_1)^T \mathbf{x} + (b_0 - b_1) = 0is perpendicular to it. The vector𝐯01=(𝐰0−𝐰1)\mathbf{v}_{01} = (\mathbf{w}_0 - \mathbf{w}_1),
which defines the boundary, is the`normal vector`and points
perpendicular to the boundary hyperplane. To move a point from the`Class 0`side to the`Class 1`side, we need to
push it in the direction`opposite`to this normal vector,
namely−𝐯01-\mathbf{v}_{01}.



We first normalize this direction vector to obtain a unit vector indicating the push direction:



𝐮push=−𝐯01∥𝐯01∥=−(𝐰0−𝐰1)∥𝐰0−𝐰1∥\mathbf{u}_{push} = \frac{-\mathbf{v}_{01}}{\|\mathbf{v}_{01}\|} = \frac{-(\mathbf{w}_0 - \mathbf{w}_1)}{\| \mathbf{w}_0 - \mathbf{w}_1 \|}





The distance we push the points is controlled by a small
hyperparameter,ϵcross\epsilon_{\text{cross}}.
This value determines how far across the boundary the neighbours are
shifted. Smaller values yield subtler changes, while larger values
create a stronger push but might make the perturbed points less
plausible as`Class 0`.





The final perturbation vectorδi\delta_iapplied to each neighbour𝐱i\mathbf{x}_iis the unit push direction scaled by the chosen magnitude:





δi=ϵcross×𝐮push\delta_i = \epsilon_{\text{cross}} \times \mathbf{u}_{push}





Applying this results in the perturbed point𝐱′i=𝐱i+δi\mathbf{x}'_i = \mathbf{x}_i + \delta_i.
We expect the original neighbour𝐱i\mathbf{x}_ito satisfyf01(𝐱i)>0f_{01}(\mathbf{x}_i) > 0,
while the perturbed point𝐱′i\mathbf{x}'_ishould satisfyf01(𝐱′i)<0f_{01}(\mathbf{x}'_i) < 0.



Code:python```
`print("\n--- Calculating Perturbation Vector ---")# Use the boundary vector w_diff_01_base = w0_base - w1_base calculated earlier# The direction to push Class 0 points into Class 1 region is opposite to the normal vector (w0-w1)push_direction=-w_diff_01_base

```

With this, we have calculated the vector to apply:

Code:python```
`---Calculating Perturbation Vector---Calculated unit push direction vector(normalized-(w0-w1)):[0.67529883-0.73754423]Perturbation magnitude(epsilon_cross):0.25Final perturbation vector(delta):[0.16882471-0.18438606]`
```



We apply this single calculated`perturbation_vector`to
each of the selected`Class 0`neighbors to generate the
poisoned dataset. We begin by creating a`safe copy`of the
original training features and labels, named`X_train_poisoned`and`y_train_poisoned`respectively. Then, we iterate through the indices of the identified
neighbours (`neighbor_indices_absolute`). For each`neighbor_idx`, we retrieve its original feature vector𝐱i\mathbf{x}_i,
calculate the perturbed vector𝐱′i=𝐱i+perturbation_vector\mathbf{x}'_i = \mathbf{x}_i + \text{perturbation\\_vector},
and update the corresponding entry in`X_train_poisoned`. The
label for this index in`y_train_poisoned`remains unchanged
as`0`, copied from the original`y_train_3c`.
This loop constructs the final poisoned dataset ready for
retraining.

The plot below shows the`poisoned training dataset`. The`target point`('+') remains unchanged in`Class 1`. The`perturbed neighbors`(points with purple edges) started as`Class 0`points (Azure) near the target but have been shifted slightly into the`Class 1`region (Yellow). This visual discrepancy - blue points in the yellow region - is what forces the model to adjust its boundary during training.
