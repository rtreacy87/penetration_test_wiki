# Identifying a Target

---



Now that we have a baseline, we can proceed with the actual`Clean Label Attack`. Our specific goal is to modify the
training data such that a chosen`target point`,𝐱target\mathbf{x}_{target},
which originally belongs to`Class 1`(Yellow), will be
misclassified by the retrained model as belonging to`Class 0`(Blue).







We aim to choose a point that genuinely belongs to`Class 1`(its true labelytarget=1y_{target} = 1)
but also lies relatively close to the decision boundary separating`Class 1`from`Class 0`, as determined by the
original baseline model. Points near the boundary are inherently more
vulnerable to misclassification if the boundary shifts, even slightly,
after retraining on the poisoned data.





To identify such a point, we can analyze the decision function scores
produced by the baseline model. Remember that the decision boundary
between`Class 0`and`Class 1`is where their
respective scores,z0z_0andz1z_1,
are equal. We can define a function representing the difference between
these scores:





f01(𝐱)=z0−z1=(𝐰0−𝐰1)T𝐱+(b0−b1)f_{01}(\mathbf{x}) = z_0 - z_1 = (\mathbf{w}_0 - \mathbf{w}_1)^T \mathbf{x} + (b_0 - b_1)





The baseline model predicts`Class 1`for a point𝐱\mathbf{x}if its scorez1z_1is greater than the scores for all other classeskk.
Specifically considering`Class 0`and`Class 1`,
the model favors`Class 1`ifz1>z0z_1 > z_0.
This condition is equivalent to the score differencef01(𝐱)f_{01}(\mathbf{x})being negative
(f01(𝐱)<0f_{01}(\mathbf{x}) < 0).





Therefore, we are looking for a specific point𝐱target\mathbf{x}_{target}within the training set that meets our criteria:ytarget=1y_{target} = 1,
and its score differencef01(𝐱target)f_{01}(\mathbf{x}_{target})must be negative (confirming the baseline model classifies it correctly
relative to`Class 0`), while also being as close to zero as
possible. A score difference that is the largest negative value
indicates the point is correctly classified but is nearest to thef01(𝐱)=0f_{01}(\mathbf{x})=0boundary.





To find this optimal target point, we calculatef01(𝐱)f_{01}(\mathbf{x})for all training points𝐱i\mathbf{x}_iwhose true labelyiy_iis 1. We then select the specific point𝐱target\mathbf{x}_{target}that yields the largest negative value (i.e., the value closest to zero)
forf01f_{01}.

```

The above code identifies a good candidate for us to work with, index`373`:

Code:python```
`---Selecting Target Point---Boundary vector(w0-w1):[-5.787925146.32142485]Intercept difference(b0-b1):-0.9207223376477074Found350Class1pointsinthe trainingset.Selected Target Point Index(absolute):373Target Point Features:[-0.55111155-0.36675028]Target PointTrueLabel(y_target):1Target Point Baseline Prediction:1Target Point Baseline0-vs-1Decision Value(f_01):-0.0493`
```

If we plot index`373`we can easily see where it is in the dataset.
