# JSMA Fundamentals

The`Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack`(`JSMA`) identifies which specific pixels most strongly influence a model's decision, then modifies only those critical features. Papernot, McDaniel, Jha, Fredrikson, Celik, and Swami demonstrated in their 2016 paper "[The Limitations of Deep Learning in Adversarial Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07528)" that targeted selection of high-influence pixels can fool models while changing remarkably few features - often just 20-40 pixels out of 784 in MNIST.



JSMA minimizes theL0L_0norm (the count of modified features) rather than perturbation
magnitude. Individual pixels can jump dramatically - from black (0.0) to
white (1.0) - if the saliency map identifies them as strategically
valuable. This creates visually apparent dots or strokes rather than
imperceptible noise, trading stealth for extreme sparsity.



## Understanding the Trade-offs: Sparsity Versus Magnitude

JSMA embodies a different philosophy from other adversarial attacks, optimizing for minimal feature modification count rather than minimal perturbation magnitude. This distinction creates a unique set of trade-offs that make JSMA ideal for certain threat models while less suitable for others.



The contrast becomes clear when we examine an example. FGSM
constrains theL∞L_\inftynorm, modifying all 784 pixels but each by at mostϵ=0.03\epsilon = 0.03,
creating nearly invisible uniform noise across the entire image.
DeepFool minimizes theL2L_2norm to find the smallest overall perturbation magnitude needed to cross
a decision boundary, typically modifying most pixels with varying
magnitudes. ElasticNet balances sparsity and magnitude, modifying
100-200 pixels with controlled changes. JSMA, by focusing on theL0L_0norm, allows individual pixels to change significantly (even saturating
from black to white) as long as the total number of modified pixels
remains small. Effective JSMA configurations can modify as few as 20-40
pixels out of 784 total, with each selected pixel potentially changing
by the full step size per iteration or being selected multiple times
before saturating.



What does sparsity mean for detectability? JSMA perturbations become visually apparent when examined closely, appearing as scattered dots or strokes rather than uniform noise. A defense system looking for widespread coordinated changes might miss these isolated modifications. The sparse nature also aids interpretation, revealing which specific features the model relies on most heavily for its decisions.

Computational cost grows linearly with the number of output classes. Why? We need one backward pass per class to build the complete Jacobian matrix. MNIST with 10 classes requires 10 backward passes per iteration, manageable on modern GPUs. ImageNet with 1000 classes demands 1000 backward passes per iteration, making the attack prohibitively expensive for real-time scenarios.

## Gradient Target And Model Choice

Computing gradients with respect to`logits`rather than`probabilities`preserves the target sensitivity`α`and competitor sum`β`as independent signals. This independence lets saliency sign constraints genuinely screen candidates based on their ability to boost the target while suppressing competitors. Post-softmax probabilities create a problem: because probabilities sum to one, differentiation forces`β = -α`by mathematical construction. This constraint collapses saliency into a squared target slope, eliminating the competitor suppression term entirely. We lose JSMA's intended behavior from the original paper.

Our demonstrations use a LeNet-like MNIST model because sparse, targeted attacks prove most reliable on this architecture. The shallow network structure with limited capacity makes individual pixels highly influential on the output decision. This mirrors the original paper's experimental setup and provides reproducible baselines. Deeper modern CNNs like ResNet distribute decision-making across many layers through skip connections and batch normalization, reducing individual pixel influence. Success rates drop substantially on these architectures, which explains why modern sparse attacks like ElasticNet and SparseFool have largely superseded JSMA for complex models.

## Intuition Through Examples: How Saliency Guides Selection

To build intuition for how JSMA selects features, let's walk through a simplified scenario. Imagine a toy model with just two input features and three output classes, where we want to force misclassification to class 2 (our target).

![Initial class scores: class 0 highest, class 1 mid, target class 2 lower](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/320/jacobian_step1_initial.png)

The visualization above shows our starting point: Class 0 is currently winning with the highest score (0.6), followed by Class 1 (0.5), while our target Class 2 lags behind at 0.3. This is the challenge JSMA must overcome. How can we modify features to flip this ranking?



Suppose the Jacobian reveals the following sensitivities. For feature
1:∂F2∂x1=0.6\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x_1} = 0.6(boosting the target by 0.6 units) and∑j≠2∂Fj∂x1=−0.4\sum_{j\ne 2} \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_1} = -0.4(decreasing other classes by 0.4 combined). This is ideal because
feature 1 helps our target and hurts competitors, yielding a saliency
score of0.6×0.4=0.240.6 \times 0.4 = 0.24.



![After increasing feature 1, target class 2 overtakes others while competitors drop](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/320/jacobian_step2_feature1.png)

Look at the effect: the target (aquamarine) increases to 0.9, while both competitors (red) drop. The arrows visualize these movements. This is what we want because the target now wins.



For feature 2:∂F2∂x2=0.3\frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x_2} = 0.3and∑j≠2∂Fj∂x2=0.5\sum_{j\ne 2} \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_2} = 0.5.
While this helps the target somewhat, it helps competitors even more.
This violates our sign condition, yielding zero saliency.



![Increasing feature 2 boosts competitors more than target; class 0 remains on top](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/320/jacobian_step3_feature2.png)

The problem becomes clear: while the target increases slightly (yellow), the other classes increase even more (aquamarine with larger arrows). Class 0 increases to 0.9, maintaining its lead. Feature 2 strengthens the original prediction, which is why JSMA rejects it.

This selection logic extends naturally to real images. Consider attacking a digit classifier on an image of a "3". We can identify which pixels along the top horizontal stroke strongly influence the "3" score while barely affecting other digits. Similarly, we know certain pixels in the middle curve boost "8" while suppressing "3".

![MNIST example: strategic pixels transform a "3" into an "8"](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/320/jacobian_step4_mnist.png)

The MNIST example shows this in action. Starting with "3" (left), JSMA identifies strategic pixels (center, hot colors) that distinguish "3" from "8". Specifically, we need to fill in the left side and strengthen the middle stroke. By modifying just these pixels, the digit can be transformed to "8" with carefully targeted changes.

## The Attack Algorithm: Iterative Refinement



Unlike single-step attacks like FGSM, JSMA operates iteratively with
a complete decision cycle at each step. We compute the Jacobian to
understand current sensitivities, construct the saliency map to identify
important features, select and modify the best feature, then update the
search space. Repetition continues until we achieve misclassification or
exhaust theL0L_0budget.



![Flow chart of JSMA cycle: compute Jacobian, build saliency map, select feature, modify, update search space](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/320/jacobian_iterative_cycle.png)



Two parameters govern the attack’s behavior: step sizeθ\thetadetermines modification magnitude per iteration, while feature budgetγ\gammalimits total sparsity as a fraction of features. Largerθ\thetavalues produce faster attacks with more visible perturbations, while
smaller values require more iterations but create subtler modifications.
The feature budgetγ\gammaimplements hard sparsity constraints, calculating the maximum number of
modifiable pixels asγ×num_features\gamma \times \text{num\\_features}.
Subsequent sections present detailed mechanics and empirical evidence
showing how these parameters affect success rates, iteration counts, and
visual quality.



## Common Pitfalls and Implementation Wisdom

Several implementation details make the difference between effective JSMA and failure.

Gradient sign interpretation causes the most common conceptual confusion. For each feature, we evaluate both increasing and decreasing its value. A negative gradient for the target class doesn't discard the feature; instead, it indicates that decreasing that feature helps achieve our goal. We evaluate both directions and choose the one with higher saliency. This is why JSMA can "erase" features (set white pixels to black) as effectively as it can "add" features (set black pixels to white).

Search space mechanics require careful management. We must remove saturated or out-of-range features promptly to avoid wasted iterations. In practice, this means checking after each modification whether the pixel has reached`clip_min`(typically 0.0) or`clip_max`(typically 1.0) and masking it out.

The monotonic mask prevents reselecting saturated pixels. Subsequent sections demonstrate these mechanics through proper implementation.



Shape management requires careful attention because gradients and
modifications operate in different coordinate systems. Computing the
Jacobian flattens the input into a 1D array for efficient gradient
extraction (a1×1×28×281 \times 1 \times 28 \times 28MNIST image becomes a vector of length 784). Selecting pixel 352 in this
flat representation corresponds to row 12, column 16 in the original 2D
grid. We must maintain consistent flattening order throughout: channel
first, then height, then width. PyTorch’s`view_as()`or`reshape()`methods restore the original structure after
modifications, but only if we flatten and unflatten using the same
convention.



Mixing flatten and reshape orders creates catastrophic bugs. Flatten in C-H-W order but reshape assuming H-W-C order? Pixel 352's modification ends up at the wrong spatial location. Worse, the attack appears to run correctly (no errors, reasonable saliency values) while modifying semantically meaningless pixels, producing zero success rate.



Memory consumption scales as classes multiplied by features, creating
practical limits on attack feasibility. MNIST requires storing(10×784)=7,840(10 \times 784) = 7,840floating-point values for the Jacobian, roughly 31 KB at single
precision. Modern GPUs handle this trivially, leaving memory for model
parameters and batch processing.





ImageNet reveals the scaling challenge. With224×224224 \times 224RGB images and 1000 classes, we need(1000×224×224×3)=150(1000 \times 224 \times 224 \times 3) = 150million values, consuming 600 MB just for the Jacobian. A typical
ResNet-50 already occupies 2-3 GB for parameters and activations,
leaving limited headroom. Chunking strategies become necessary: compute
gradients for 100 classes at a time, accumulate results on CPU, repeat.
This trades memory for computation time but enables attacks on
hardware-constrained systems.



Debugging benefits from visualization at each iteration. We can plot the saliency map as a heatmap to verify that high-saliency regions align with our intuition about important features. Tracking the target class confidence over iterations ensures it generally increases.



If the attack stagnates, examine whether the search space is
shrinking too quickly due to aggressive boundary saturation. This
suggests a smallerθ\thetavalue might help. The visualization section demonstrates these debugging
techniques with actual examples.
