# Environment Setup

ElasticNet requires significantly more computation than single-step attacks like FGSM. Each FISTA iteration performs forward and backward passes, with hundreds of iterations nested inside 5-10 binary search steps.

The`HTB Evasion Library`provides standardized infrastructure across all attack implementations: model architectures, MNIST data loaders, training loops, and visualization utilities. This consistency lets us focus on attack mechanics rather than boilerplate.

Code:bash```
`# Install the AI Library (or update it)pipinstall--upgrade git+https://github.com/PandaSt0rm/htb-ai-library`
```

The setup follows a familiar pattern. We use`set_reproducibility(1337)`to ensure deterministic behavior across runs by fixing random seeds for PyTorch, NumPy, and CUDA. Device configuration automatically detects GPU availability, falling back to CPU when necessary. The HTB color constants (`HTB_GREEN`,`NODE_BLACK`, etc.) maintain visual consistency across all visualizations, with`use_htb_style()`applying the theme globally to matplotlib.

## Building the Target Model

ElasticNet targets`MNISTClassifierWithDropout`, a convolutional architecture with 2 conv layers (dropout rate 0.25) and 2 fully connected layers (dropout rate 0.5). Dropout serves dual purposes: preventing overfitting during training and creating a more realistic target that reflects production models with regularization.

Training from scratch takes several minutes even on GPU. When experimenting with attack parameters, retraining repeatedly wastes resources. The checkpoint caching approach checks for an existing`mnist_target.pth`file. If found, we load the saved weights directly. If absent, we train for 5 epochs and save the result. This makes the first run slower (training required) but all subsequent runs instant (weights loaded from disk).

Code:python```
`# Get data loaders using library functiontrain_loader,test_loader=get_mnist_loaders(batch_size=128)print(f"Training samples:{len(train_loader.dataset)}")print(f"Test samples:{len(test_loader.dataset)}")# Create output directory for saving models and resultsoutput_dir=Path("output")output_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)# Define model checkpoint path in output directorymodel_path=output_dir/"mnist_target.pth"# Initialize model using MNISTClassifierWithDropout from librarymodel=MNISTClassifierWithDropout(num_classes=10).to(device)# Check if trained model exists, otherwise train from scratchifmodel_path.exists():print(f"\nLoading existing model from{model_path}")model=load_model(model,model_path,device)else:print(f"\nNo existing model found.

```

Expected output (first run, training from scratch):

Code:txt```
`Training samples: 60000
Test samples: 10000

No existing model found. Training new model...
Epoch 1/5: Avg Loss = 0.2761, Test Accuracy = 98.07%

Epoch 4/5: Avg Loss = 0.0616, Test Accuracy = 98.90%
Epoch 5/5: Avg Loss = 0.0529, Test Accuracy = 98.89%
Saving trained model to output/mnist_target.pth

```

Expected output (subsequent runs, loading existing model):

Loading existing model from output/mnist_target.pth

### Memory and Storage Details

How does batching affect memory usage? Each MNIST image occupies 28×28 = 784 pixels × 4 bytes (float32) = 3,136 bytes (~3.06 KiB). A batch of 128 images requires 128 × 3,136 bytes = 401,408 bytes (~392 KiB) for input data alone. Adding gradients, activations, and optimizer state for a CNN with 2 conv layers and 2 FC layers brings total per-batch memory to roughly 50-80 MB. Doubling the batch size to 256 would double memory usage to 100-160 MB while providing more stable gradient estimates but slower per-epoch iteration. The 128-image batch size balances these tradeoffs effectively for MNIST.

What gets serialized in the checkpoint file? When`save_model`writes`mnist_target.pth`, it creates a Python pickle containing an OrderedDict that maps parameter names (like`conv1.weight`,`fc2.bias`) to their tensor values. This`.pth`file stores all convolutional filters, batch norm statistics, and fully connected weights as floating-point arrays. When`load_model`reads this file, PyTorch's deserialization restores the exact numerical values from the previous training session, down to the last floating-point bit. This ensures perfect reproducibility across sessions while eliminating redundant training.

The final test accuracy of 98.89% (9,889 out of 10,000 examples classified correctly) confirms the model learned effectively while remaining well-regularized. With 98.89% accuracy, we have 9,889 potential attack targets in the test set, providing ample examples for evaluating ElasticNet's effectiveness against properly regularized neural networks.
