# Jacobian and Gradients

To rank pixels by their attack effectiveness, JSMA needs sensitivity information for every class-pixel pair. Computing the full Jacobian matrix requires one backward pass per output class, then extracting target and competitor gradients for saliency scoring. The implementation divides into focused functions: gradient computation, extraction, and masking.

## Setup

To implement JSMA's gradient-based saliency scoring, we need PyTorch for automatic differentiation, NumPy for efficient array operations, and the HTB Evasion Library for model infrastructure. Let's configure the environment with the same standardized setup used throughout this series:

```
`importtorchimporttorch.nnasnnimporttorch.nn.functionalasFimportnumpyasnpimportmatplotlib.pyplotaspltfrompathlibimportPathimportwarnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')fromhtb_ai_library.coreimportset_reproducibilityfromhtb_ai_library.dataimportget_mnist_loadersfromhtb_ai_library.modelsimportSimpleLeNetfromhtb_ai_library.trainingimporttrain_modelfromhtb_ai_library.utilsimportsave_model,load_modelfromhtb_ai_library.visualizationimportuse_htb_style

```

To train and evaluate our attacks, we need properly loaded data and a pre-trained target model. Let's set up both using checkpoint caching to avoid redundant training:

```
`train_loader,test_loader=get_mnist_loaders(batch_size=128)model_path=output_dir/'mnist_target.pth'model=SimpleLeNet().to(device)ifmodel_path.exists():print(f"Loading existing model from{model_path}")model=load_model(model,model_path,device)else:print(f"Training new model...")model=train_model(model,train_loader,test_loader,epochs=5,learning_rate=0.001,device=device)save_model(model,model_path)model.eval()print(f"Model ready for attacks")`
```

Expected output:

```
`Using device: cuda
Loading existing model from output/mnist_target.pth
Model loaded from output/mnist_target.pth
Model ready for attacks`
```

With the environment configured and model loaded, we can now implement the Jacobian computation functions.

## Jacobian Computation



Our Jacobian matrix captures how each output class responds to
changes in each input pixel. For a model withmmclasses and input withnnpixels, the Jacobian has shape(m,n)(m, n).
Computing this matrix requiresmmbackward passes, one per class, which is the computational bottleneck of
JSMA.



To build the complete saliency map, we need per-class gradients showing how each pixel influences each output. This information feeds directly into saliency scoring. Let's start by implementing gradient extraction for a single class:

```
`defcompute_class_gradient(x,model,class_idx,wrt='logits'):x_grad=x.detach().requires_grad_(True)logits=model(x_grad)ifwrt=='logits':scalar=logits[0,class_idx]else:probs=F.softmax(logits,dim=1)scalar=probs[0,class_idx]scalar.backward()grad=x_grad.grad.detach().cpu().numpy().flatten().copy()returngrad`
```



During the forward pass`model(x_grad)`, PyTorch’s
autograd builds a computation graph tracking which operations produced
each tensor. We then call`backward()`on a scalar to trigger
reverse-mode differentiation. Gradients flow backward through this
graph, accumulating at each operation. Why must we use a scalar?
Autograd needs a definite starting point (a rank-0 single value, not a
tensor). Indexing with`[0, class_idx]`extracts the specific
class score we care about, converting the1×C1 \times Clogit tensor into a single number.





Why flatten and copy? Gradients arrive as a1×1×28×281 \times 1 \times 28 \times 28tensor matching the input shape, but saliency scoring operates on
vectors. Flattening in C-H-W order produces a length-784 vector where
index 352 consistently refers to channel 0, row 12, column 16. We call`.copy()`to create an independent numpy array, severing all
ties to PyTorch’s computation graph. Without this copy, the gradient
tensor remains a view into GPU memory that PyTorch might overwrite
during the next backward pass.



As established earlier, we compute gradients with respect to`logits`(pre-softmax) to preserve independent target and competitor sensitivities for accurate saliency scoring. Let's test this on a simple example:

```
`importtorchimporttorch.nnasnnimporttorch.nn.functionalasFimportnumpyasnp# Simple 2-class model for testingmodel_test=nn.Sequential(nn.Flatten(),nn.Linear(4,2))model_test.eval()# Test input: 1×1×2×2 imagex_test=torch.tensor([[[[0.5,0.3],[0.2,0.8]]]],requires_grad=True)# Compute gradient for class 0grad_class0=compute_class_gradient(x_test,model_test,0,wrt='logits')print(f"Gradient shape:{grad_class0.shape}")print(f"Gradient for class 0:{grad_class0}")`
```

Output:

```
`Gradient shape: (4,)
Gradient for class 0: [-0.3841548  -0.4724946   0.04130501 -0.23387289]`
```

Looking at this gradient, we see how each of the 4 pixels affects class 0's score. Positive values mean increasing that pixel boosts class 0. Negative values mean increasing it suppresses class 0.

With the single-class gradient function working, we can now build the complete Jacobian by collecting gradients for all classes. Each row represents one class's sensitivity to all input features:

```
`defcompute_jacobian_matrix(x,model,num_classes=10,wrt='logits'):ifx.shape[0]!=1:raiseValueError("compute_jacobian_matrix expects batch size 1")jacobian=[]forclass_idxinrange(num_classes):grad=compute_class_gradient(x,model,class_idx,wrt)jacobian.append(grad)returnnp.asarray(jacobian)`
```

Why enforce batch size 1? Passing a batch of 4 images would compute gradients averaged across all 4 (PyTorch's default backward behavior), producing meaningless results for per-sample attacks. Validating`batch_size=1`makes the contract explicit: one image in, one Jacobian out. Without this check, a developer might accidentally pass batched data and debug for hours wondering why saliency maps look wrong.



Building the matrix happens row by row through list accumulation.
Each`compute_class_gradient`call triggers a separate
backward pass, which for MNIST with 10 classes means 10 independent
gradient computations, 10 graph traversals, and 10 memory allocations.
This sequential approach is computationally expensive (taking 10-15ms
total) but unavoidable (PyTorch requires separate backward passes for
each output scalar). Finally,`np.asarray()`converts the
list of 1D arrays into a proper(m,n)(m, n)matrix where rowiiholds∂Fi∂xj\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_j}for all pixelsjj.



Let's verify the shape on MNIST:

```
`# MNIST example: 1×1×28×28 input, 10 classes# Jacobian should be (10, 784)print(f"For MNIST:{10}classes ×{28*28}pixels ={10*28*28}values")print(f"Expected Jacobian shape: (10, 784)")`
```

Output:

```
`For MNIST: 10 classes × 784 pixels = 7840 values
Expected Jacobian shape: (10, 784)`
```

## Gradient Extraction and Masking

With the Jacobian computed, we need to extract the relevant gradients for saliency scoring. The saliency formula requires two components: the target class gradient and the sum of all other class gradients. We separate these components because we want pixels that boost the target while suppressing competitors.

Let's implement these extraction functions:

```
`defextract_target_gradient(jacobian,target_class):returnjacobian[target_class].copy()defextract_other_gradients(jacobian,target_class):target_grad=jacobian[target_class]total_grad=jacobian.sum(axis=0)other_grad=total_grad-target_gradreturnother_grad`
```

Grabbing the target gradient requires indexing into row`target_class`and copying. Why copy instead of returning the view directly? Numpy's row indexing returns a view sharing memory with the original Jacobian. If we modify this view later (say, applying a search space mask), we'd corrupt the Jacobian matrix, causing subsequent extractions to use contaminated gradients. Copying creates an independent array, isolating our modifications from the source data.



Combining all non-target classes into "others" could use manual
looping
(`for i in range(num_classes): if i != target_class: sum += jacobian[i]`),
but array operations run orders of magnitude faster. Summing all rows
with`jacobian.sum(axis=0)`gives the total gradient across
all classes. Subtracting the target class gradient isolates the combined
effect on competitors through simple arithmetic:β=sum(all)−α\beta = \text{sum(all)} - \alpha.
For a 3-class problem with target=2, if class 0 has gradient[0.2,0.5][0.2, 0.5],
class 1 has[−0.1,0.2][-0.1, 0.2],
and class 2 has[0.6,−0.3][0.6, -0.3],
then the total is[0.2+(−0.1)+0.6,0.5+0.2+(−0.3)]=[0.7,0.4][0.2+(-0.1)+0.6, 0.5+0.2+(-0.3)] = [0.7, 0.4]and others becomes[0.7−0.6,0.4−(−0.3)]=[0.1,0.7][0.7-0.6, 0.4-(-0.3)] = [0.1, 0.7].



Example on toy data:

```
`# Toy Jacobian: 3 classes, 4 featuresJ_toy=np.array([[0.2,0.5,-0.1,0.3],# Class 0[-0.1,0.2,0.4,-0.2],# Class 1[0.6,-0.3,0.1,0.5]# Class 2])target=2alpha=extract_target_gradient(J_toy,target)beta=extract_other_gradients(J_toy,target)print(f"Target gradient (class{target}):{alpha}")print(f"Other gradients sum:{beta}")`
```

Output:

```
`Target gradient (class 2): [ 0.6 -0.3  0.1  0.5]
Other gradients sum:       [ 0.1  0.7  0.3  0.1]`
```

For pixel 0: target gradient is 0.6 (increasing helps target), other gradient sum is 0.1 (increasing helps competitors slightly). For pixel 1: target gradient is -0.3 (increasing hurts target), other gradient sum is 0.7 (increasing helps competitors a lot). These gradient signs determine which modification directions are favorable, a concept formalized through sign constraints in the saliency scoring functions.

These gradient values feed directly into saliency scoring, but first we need to mask out pixels that are no longer available for modification:

```
`defapply_search_mask(gradient,search_space):returngradient*search_space`
```

How do Boolean masks enable efficient feature filtering? Through element-wise multiplication. The`search_space`array contains`True`for available pixels and`False`for unavailable ones. Numpy's broadcasting converts`True→1.0`and`False→0.0`during multiplication, effectively zeroing gradients for unavailable pixels while preserving others. Why this approach instead of fancy indexing? Masked multiplication preserves array shape and index correspondence. Pixel 352 remains at position 352, just with gradient 0.0 if unavailable. Fancy indexing would create a smaller array of only available pixels, breaking index alignment with the original image.

Example:

```
`# Gradient with 5 featuresgrad=np.array([0.5,-0.2,0.8,0.1,-0.4])# Mask: features 1 and 3 already usedmask=np.array([True,False,True,False,True])masked_grad=apply_search_mask(grad,mask)print(f"Original gradient:{grad}")print(f"Search space mask:{mask}")print(f"Masked gradient:{masked_grad}")`
```

Output:

```
`Original gradient: [ 0.5 -0.2  0.8  0.1 -0.4]
Search space mask: [ True False  True False  True]
Masked gradient:   [ 0.5  0.   0.8  0.  -0.4]`
```

Features 1 and 3 are zeroed out, preventing them from being selected again.

With these gradient extraction and masking functions complete, we have the necessary inputs for saliency scoring. The next section builds the scoring logic that determines which pixel to modify at each iteration.
