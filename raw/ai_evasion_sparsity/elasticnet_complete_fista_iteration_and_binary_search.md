# Complete FISTA Iteration and Binary Search

Each FISTA iteration orchestrates gradient descent on smooth terms with proximal operations for sparsity, accelerated by momentum. Binary search wraps this optimization, automatically tuning the adversarial pressure to find minimal perturbations. These nested loops create ElasticNet's adaptive behavior - adjusting both perturbation refinement (FISTA) and attack strength (binary search) to each example's difficulty.

## The Complete FISTA Iteration

To execute one FISTA step, we evaluate the loss at the momentum point (not the current solution), apply gradient descent, enforce sparsity through soft thresholding, then extrapolate the next momentum position. This look-ahead evaluation is what accelerates convergence beyond standard proximal gradient methods.

Code:python```
`deffista_step(adv_images,y_momentum,original_images,labels_onehot,const,model,beta,learning_rate,confidence,iteration,targeted=False,clip_min=0.0,clip_max=1.0,):"""
    Perform one complete FISTA iteration.

    Combines gradient computation, shrinkage-thresholding,
    and momentum update into a single optimization step.

    Parameters:
        adv_images (torch.Tensor): Current adversarial images
        y_momentum (torch.Tensor): Momentum point for gradient evaluation
        original_images (torch.Tensor): Original clean images

    Returns:
        tuple: (new_adv_images, new_y_momentum, loss_value, distances)

```

Why detach and then immediately require gradients again? The preparation serves a critical purpose. The`detach()`call breaks any existing gradient tape from previous iterations, severing the computational graph that PyTorch built during the last FISTA step. Without this break, gradients would accumulate incorrectly across iterations, creating memory leaks and producing wrong gradient values. The`requires_grad_(True)`call then tells PyTorch to start fresh, tracking operations on this tensor for the current iteration only.



Where do we evaluate the loss? At the momentum pointy(k)y^{(k)},
not the current solutionx(k)x^{(k)}.
This look-ahead evaluation is what makes FISTA faster than standard
proximal gradient methods. By computing gradients at an extrapolated
point that anticipates where optimization is heading, FISTA better
exploits momentum in consistent directions. The gradient tells us which
direction reduces loss from this forward-looking position.





Taking the gradient step, we move against the gradient to decrease
loss:`y_new = y_momentum - learning_rate * grad`. The
learning rate controls step size, balancing between fast convergence
(large steps) and stability (small steps). Next, shrinkage handles the
non-smoothL1L_1term. Small perturbations die (values below thresholdβ\betaget zeroed). Larger perturbations survive with reduction (values aboveβ\betaget shrunk by exactlyβ\beta).



Finally, momentum extrapolation anticipates where we're heading. The term`(adv_new - adv_images)`represents the change made in this iteration. Multiplying by`momentum_coef`and adding to`adv_new`produces a point slightly ahead of the current solution:`y_new_momentum = adv_new + momentum_coef * (adv_new - adv_images)`. The next iteration will compute gradients at this look-ahead point, building on the progress direction established by this step.

## Checking Attack Success

Binary search requires feedback about whether current perturbations successfully fool the model. We compare model predictions on adversarial examples to true labels through the success check, determining which examples achieved misclassification. This boolean feedback guides the search toward minimal perturbations sufficient for attack success.

Code:python```
`defcheck_attack_success(adv_images,labels,model,targeted=False):"""
    Verify whether adversarial examples achieve misclassification.

    Compares model predictions on adversarial images to target labels.

    Parameters:
        adv_images (torch.Tensor): Adversarial images to evaluate
        labels (torch.Tensor): True labels (or target labels if targeted)
        model (nn.Module): Target model
        targeted (bool): Whether this is a targeted attack

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Boolean mask indicating successful attacks (batch_size,)
    """withtorch.no_grad():outputs=model(adv_images)predictions=outputs.argmax(dim=1)iftargeted:# Success = prediction matches targetsuccess=predictions.eq(labels)else:# Success = prediction differs from true labelsuccess=predictions.ne(labels)returnsuccess`
```

We run the success check in inference mode without gradient tracking (`torch.no_grad()`). No optimization occurs here; we simply evaluate whether the current perturbations achieve our goal. The forward pass produces logits, which we convert to class predictions via`argmax`.

For untargeted attacks, success means the prediction differs from the true label. Any misclassification counts as success; we don't care which wrong class the model predicts. For targeted attacks, success requires the prediction to match a specific target class. The targeted threat model is more constrained and typically requires larger perturbations.

This success criterion is binary: an example either fools the model or it doesn't. No notion of "partially successful" or "almost working" exists. This hard threshold contrasts with the soft margin in the adversarial loss. During optimization, the loss provides smooth gradients even when attacks haven't succeeded. After optimization, the success check provides definitive feedback for the binary search.

## Updating Binary Search Bounds



The binary search maintains lower and upper bounds on the trade-off
constantccfor each example. Successful attacks indicateccwas sufficient (possibly too large), so we lower the upper bound. Failed
attacks indicateccwas insufficient, so we raise the lower bound. After several iterations,
the bounds converge to the minimalccsufficient for attack success.



Code:python```
`defupdate_binary_search_bounds(lower_bound,upper_bound,const,success_mask):"""
    Update binary search bounds based on attack success.

    Successful attacks lower upper bound (c was sufficient).
    Failed attacks raise lower bound (c was insufficient).

    Parameters:
        lower_bound (torch.Tensor): Lower bounds on c per example
        upper_bound (torch.Tensor): Upper bounds on c per example
        const (torch.Tensor): Current c values per example
        success_mask (torch.Tensor): Boolean mask of successful attacks

    Returns:
        tuple: (new_lower_bound, new_upper_bound, new_const)
    """# Process each example individuallyforiinrange(len(success_mask)):ifsuccess_mask[i]:# Success: try smaller cupper_bound[i]=min(upper_bound[i],const[i])ifupper_bound[i]<1e10:const[i]=(lower_bound[i]+upper_bound[i])/2else:# Failure: need larger clower_bound[i]=max(lower_bound[i],const[i])ifupper_bound[i]<1e10:const[i]=(lower_bound[i]+upper_bound[i])/2else:const[i]*=10# Exponential increase for persistent failuresreturnlower_bound,upper_bound,const`
```



The bisection mechanism from ElasticNet operates here through
per-example bounds. Processing examples independently accommodates
heterogeneous robustness: some examples lie far from decision boundaries
and resist perturbation (needing largeccvalues), while others sit near boundaries and flip easily (requiring
smallccvalues).





The implementation follows standard bisection logic. Successful
attacks tighten the upper bound to the current constant, signaling we
can try smaller values. Failed attacks raise the lower bound, indicating
this constant was insufficient. When both bounds are finite, we bisect
by computing their midpoint. This produces the logarithmic convergence
described in ElasticNet: each iteration halves the search interval.





Exponential growth (line 176) handles the unbounded case where no
success has occurred yet. Multiplyingccby 10 each iteration explores the scale space efficiently
(0.001,0.01,0.1,1,10,100,...0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, ...)
without wasting iterations on tiny increments. Once we find success at
any scale, bisection takes over to refine the estimate. To see this in
practice: starting withlower=0\text{lower}=0,upper=1010\text{upper}=10^{10},c=0.001c=0.001,
a success setsupper=0.001\text{upper}=0.001and bisects toc=0.0005c=0.0005.
A subsequent failure setslower=0.0005\text{lower}=0.0005and bisects toc=0.00075c=0.00075.
After five such steps, the interval narrows by25=32×2^5=32\times.



## Putting FISTA and Binary Search Together

Complete attack execution nests FISTA optimization inside binary search iterations. An outer loop adjusts the trade-off constants based on success feedback. An inner loop optimizes perturbations for fixed constants, then we evaluate results. This separation isolates two subproblems: minimizing distortion (FISTA) and tuning adversarial pressure (binary search).

Each binary search iteration runs FISTA to convergence (or a maximum iteration limit). The resulting adversarial examples undergo success checks, providing feedback for the binary search update. The updated constants seed the next FISTA optimization round, which starts fresh from the original images. This fresh start prevents perturbations from growing unboundedly across binary search iterations.

This interplay between loops creates adaptive behavior. Easy examples converge quickly: FISTA succeeds early, binary search finds small optimal constants after few iterations. Hard examples take longer: FISTA needs many iterations to achieve misclassification, binary search explores larger constants across many steps. The algorithm adapts automatically to each example's difficulty.



This adaptive complexity is unique to ElasticNet among the attacks
you’ve studied. FGSM has no adaptation; it uses fixedϵ\epsilonfor all examples. DeepFool adapts through iteration count but uses the
same algorithm for all examples. ElasticNet adapts both through FISTA
iterations (finding perturbations) and binary search iterations (tuning
pressure), providing fine-grained control over the attack process.



The next section shows these components operating together in the complete attack execution. Binary search iterations wrap FISTA optimization, adjusting constants based on success feedback. Configuration sets hyperparameters. Sample selection identifies attack targets. Result analysis quantifies effectiveness. The nested loop structure becomes explicit, showing exactly when binary search updates occur, when FISTA restarts from originals, and how the best perturbations get tracked across iterations.
